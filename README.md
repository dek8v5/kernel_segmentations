# kernel_segmentations

this is a simple code to segment kernel on a black background. 

the raw frames includes several frames from different prespectives. 

I mosaic them first using my mosaic algorithm, then use the whole mosaic image as the input for this algorithm

output: segmented kernels, overlay kernels, count how many kernels in total, and the features of each kernels.
